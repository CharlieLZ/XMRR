[$1,000 MRR!!!! ✅](https://x.com/adi808080/status/1809953026628600087)

After 6 months of building and growing my AI app development platform, I've finally hit this major milestone. Interestingly, it took 5 months to go from 0 to 500 but less than a month for 500 to 1k 😮

Oct. 2023 - Dec. 2023 (Idea & Getting users)
Dec. 2023 - Jan. 2024 (Launch):
Jan. 2024 - Current(Growth):

What has worked: 
- Meta ads with a clear messaging about the product and a CTA. I've spent close to $200 on Meta ads so far and the conversion rate has been 2x!
- Affiliate marketing: I'm rewarding affiliates with a 35% commission on all paid sales. It costs me $29/mo to run the program but it makes up for 2% of my subscriptions. 
- Testimonials: I use another service for collecting text + video testimonials which costs me $19/mo, so far I've collected almost 20 quality testimonials from customers and featured them on the home page. Testimonials help build trust - people like to use products that are trusted by others. 
- Organic growth: majority of the customers discover my platform organically or by word of mouth, which is the best form of marketing. 
- Product demo videos: I started screen recording myself building AI apps and shared clips on YT, X, and LinkedIn. 
- Reddit: This is the ultimate, unbiased validation imo. if you can get ppl to appreciate ur product there, then it definitely has some real potential! For me, what seemed to work was to show how creators were making money for real on the platform. 
- Blogging: I've written several articles discussing how the platform works and the problems it can solve. It costs me $0 to maintain the Medium blog and has brought me a lot of traffic. 
- Network effects: this is a product advantage, most of the apps built through my platform have a "powered by pmfm" label and link to the platform. 
- Building in public and sharing progress updates (like this) which attracts creator and other founder customers. More importantly, it helps me remain accountable as a solo founder!

![Started this journey 100% broke.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQ4NzLoaEAAsEIL?format=png&name=small)

Almost immediately we did 200k downloads on $100 ad spend.

RizzGPT quickly scaled up to $200k/month and has been steady ever since. Renamed to PlugAI.

---

In our first three months, we went from 100k MRR to 200k MRR to 500k MRR.

Since then, we have remained around 500k MRR.

I launched my third app about 2 months ago and we are at 100k in June.

[I just sold my startup Talknotes for $200,000 ](https://x.com/nico_jeannen/status/1808130671493406761)

I launched it last August when I was looking for an idea I could grow with paid ads, and made a MVP in one week.

I took it from $0 to $7500 MRR in just 11 months.

💡 Idea: 
I got the idea when I tried to write a tweet using Google Doc's transcription tool, but it was terrible. 


✅ Validation:
My rule is to only reinvest what the project generates, so, no ads until I make enough cashflow ❌

Listing on startup directories + a few Twitter sales generated $700 after 10 days. 

It got Product of the Day and reached $1500 MRR thanks to the media coverage 🚀🚀


The strategy is simple:
Catch people's attention, and show them how the app can help them improve their life. No need to over-complicate 🙅‍♂️


Thanks to the boost in traffic, I implemented a feedback loop:
1) Get new users 👥
2) Learn to know them with the onboarding form 💬
3) Make more ads based on the data you get from onboarding 📝

And it completely blew up. MRR doubled in ~2 months


Surprisingly, doing absolutely nothing is 10x more exhausting than working 15h per day 🥱


I launched over 40 projects in those 7 years, and most of them failed. But a few took off, and that’s all I needed


You only need to win once to snowball everything. Work hard, focus, fail a lot and keep shipping fast. 🚀🚀
